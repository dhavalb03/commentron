# Extension Loading Issue - RESOLVED

## Problem
The Chrome extension failed to load with the error:
```
Could not load icon 'icons/icon16.png' specified in 'icons'.
Could not load manifest.
```

## Cause
The manifest.json file referenced icon files that didn't exist in the icons folder.

## Solution Applied
Removed the icon references from manifest.json. The extension will now use Chrome's default extension icon (a puzzle piece).

## Current Status
✅ Extension should now load successfully without icon errors
✅ All functionality remains intact
✅ Uses default Chrome extension icon

## Optional: Adding Custom Icons Later

If you want custom icons later, you can:

1. Create PNG files with these exact names in the icons/ folder:
   - icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
   - icon32.png (32x32 pixels)  
   - icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
   - icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

2. Then add this back to manifest.json:
```json
  "icons": {
    "16": "icons/icon16.png",
    "32": "icons/icon32.png",
    "48": "icons/icon48.png",
    "128": "icons/icon128.png"
  },
```

## How to Load the Extension Now

1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the `commentron-custom` folder
5. The extension should load successfully!
