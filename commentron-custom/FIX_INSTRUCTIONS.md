## Debug Console Commands

To check what's happening, open Chrome DevTools (F12) on LinkedIn and look for:

1. **Successful initialization:**
   ```
   ðŸš€ CommenTron initializing...
   âœ… LinkedInCommentBot setup complete!
   ```

2. **Comment button detection:**
   ```
   Comment button with artdeco-button__text clicked!
   Comment button click handler triggered!
   ```

3. **API communication:**
   ```
   Sending message to background script...
   Background: Received generateComment request
   Background: Generated comment successfully
   ```

## File Changes Summary
- `manifest.json`: Added notifications permission
- `background.js`: Enhanced error handling, timeout, and API validation
- `content.js`: Improved message handling with timeout
- `test-api.html`: New testing tool for API verification

## Next Steps if Still Failing

1. **Check the test-api.html results** - This will tell you if the issue is with the API key or the extension
2. **Look at browser console errors** - Specific error messages will guide the solution
3. **Try a fresh API key** - Sometimes keys get corrupted or quota issues occur
4. **Check LinkedIn page structure** - LinkedIn sometimes changes their class names

The most likely issue is either:
- Invalid/expired API key
- API quota exceeded
- Network connectivity problems
- Extension context invalidation

The improved error messages should now clearly indicate which of these is causing the problem.
